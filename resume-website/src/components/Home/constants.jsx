const ABOUT = `
Welcome to my website! My name is Sam Ebersole, and I am a Full-Stack Developer currently living in New York City, USA, though I am moving to Berlin, Germany this winter.


In May 2022 I graduated cum laude from Hunter College with a Bachelor's of Arts. My majors were Computer Science and History, and I minored in Mathematics and German. While in college, I worked primarily with C++ as part of the Hunter CS program's mains series of courses. I additionally gained experience with Python, especially during my Artificial Intelligence course, and with React, during both my Intro to Modern Web Development course and my capstone project.


After graduating, I began work at DataMixMaster, where I am a frontend developer primarily using React. In addition to React, I also use Flask and MongoDB when I have to work on the backend. As a frontend developer, I write automated tests, review and debug code, and implement new features. During my time at DataMixMaster, new features that I implemented have been successfully demoed to customers, resulting in the securing of higher contracts.
