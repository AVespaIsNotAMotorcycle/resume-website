const ABOUT = `
In May 2022 I graduated cum laude from Hunter College with a Bachelor's of Arts. My majors were Computer Science and History, and I minored in Mathematics and German. While in college, I worked primarily with C++ as part of the Hunter CS program's main series of courses. I additionally gained experience with Python, especially during my Artificial Intelligence course, and with React, during both my Intro to Modern Web Development course and my capstone project.


After graduating, I began work at DataMixMaster, where I am a frontend developer primarily using React. In addition to React, I also have limited exposure to Flask and MongoDB, as I run our backend locally when developing to avoid unnecessary changes to production. As a frontend developer following a CI/CD methodology, I write automated tests for new and existing code to ensure stability, develop and deploy new features, and review and maintain an existing codebase. While working at DataMixMaster, features I implemented have been used to secure higher contracts from clients.
